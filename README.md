Shannon entropy calculation for amino acid multiple sequence alignment

This repository contains a Python script to calculate Shannon entropy for an amino acid multiple sequence alignment.
It supports a scientific manuscript,
Crespo-Bellido et al.

The python code was simplified slightly
from code written by Erik Lavington:

Very similar code was used
for a paper by Dubey et al. (2023).
