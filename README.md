Shannon entropy calculation for amino acid multiple sequence alignment

This repository contains a Python script to calculate Shannon entropy for an amino acid multiple sequence alignment.
It supports a scientific paper,
Crespo-Bellido et al. 2024
https://doi.org/npd8

The python code was simplified slightly
from code written by Erik Lavington:

Very similar code was used
for a paper by Dubey et al. (2023; https://doi.org/jhz5).
